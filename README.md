EYE-IN-HAND calibration using opencv

# How to run
To execute, just run the "calibrate.py" file.

# Notes
Inside the images" folder, you should put all the different charuco photos.
Inside the "images_transformation_info.txt" file, you should put the corresponding poses of the gripper (gripper2base transformations).

All the images were taken in 1280*720 definition in my case.

# Motivation and rights
This is a streamlined solution of the problem of eye in hand calibration using opencv.

This was created due to the fact that no proper, clean documentation was found in the internet while I was searching for it.
Hopefully, it will accelerate the projects of many robotic engineers out there, who are dealing with robotic arm manipulation and need to perform a quick intrinsic and extrinsic calibration using a robot arm and an attached camera to the gripper.

Feel free to use the code in ANY way you want.
