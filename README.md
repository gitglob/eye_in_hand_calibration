EYE-IN-HAND calibration using opencv

# Motivation and rights
This is a streamlined solution of the problem of eye in hand calibration using opencv.

This was created due to the fact that no proper, clean documentation was found in the internet while I was searching for it.
Hopefully, it will accelerate the projects of many robotic engineers out there, who are dealing with robotic arm manipulation and need to perform a quick intrinsic and extrinsic calibration using a robot arm and an attached camera to the gripper.

Feel free to use the code in ANY way you want.
