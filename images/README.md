# Guide to taking charuco images for calibration

Move the camera, which is attached to the robotic gripper, to random 3d positions, and take photos from the charuco board.
For my case, 41 did the work, but feel free to experiment with more/less.
When you have taken a photo, don't forget to save the forward kinematics (the pose of the gripper w.r.t. the base coordinate frame).

In this folder, place all the images that you have taken, as png files.
